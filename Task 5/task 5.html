            The MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, Node.js) stack is a JavaScript-based full-stack development framework used for building web applications. MongoDB is used for the database, Express.js for server-side scripting, Angular for the front-end, and Node.js for server-side runtime.

        <dd>
            The MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack is another JavaScript-based full-stack development framework similar to MEAN, but with React as the front-end library. It is popular for building single-page applications (SPAs).
